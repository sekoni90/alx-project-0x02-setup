# Project Description
This project is a comprehensive introduction to setting up and working with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It guides you through creating a modern web application with reusable components, routing, API integration, and proper project structure. The project covers fundamental concepts from initial setup to building interactive components and fetching data from external APIs.

# Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:

Understand how to scaffold a Next.js application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
Learn to implement basic routing in Next.js using the Pages Router
Create reusable components with TypeScript interfaces
Implement interactive UI elements like modals and buttons
Fetch and display data from external APIs
Structure a Next.js project following best practices
Work with component props and state management
Build responsive layouts with navigation
# Requirements
Node.js (v16 or later)
npm or yarn package manager
Basic knowledge of React and TypeScript
Familiarity with HTML/CSS
Git and GitHub account
Code editor (VS Code recommended)
Best Practices
# Project Structure:

Organize components by domain (layout, common, etc.)
Keep interfaces in a dedicated folder
Separate pages according to routes
# Component Design:

Create reusable, modular components
Use TypeScript interfaces for props
Follow single responsibility principle
# Code Quality:

Use ESLint for linting
Maintain consistent code style
Add meaningful comments where necessary
# Performance:

Optimize API calls
Implement lazy loading where appropriate
Use Tailwind CSS for efficient styling
Documentation:

# Maintain a clear README
Document component props and usage
Keep commit messages descriptive

# Implementation Guide
Start by setting up the Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
Implement basic routing with the Pages Router
Build reusable components one by one, starting with simple ones (Card, Button)
Progress to more complex components (Modal, PostCard, UserCard)
Implement the Header component for navigation
Fetch and display data from JSONPlaceholder API
Test each component and page as you build them
# Expected Outcomes
A fully functional Next.js application
Reusable components that follow TypeScript best practices
Proper routing between different pages
API integration to fetch and display data
Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
Clean, well-organized codebase
